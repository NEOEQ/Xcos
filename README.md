Welcome to the Wiki page of Xcos projects applied to engineering. The purpose of this group is to make available Xcos engineering projects for academic projects.

Since Scilab / Xcos is a free tool, it is possible for anyone interested in learning process control to collaborate. The project files will be available online and can be downloaded and modified by anyone, as well as explanatory tutorials.

For each example discussed here, there is a tutorial containing a discussion on the control theory and also the basic steps for the problem simulation.
